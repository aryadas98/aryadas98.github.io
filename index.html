    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in lunar exploration missions, driven by the efforts of governments,
      private companies, and international collaborations. The Moon has garnered substantial attention due to its potential as a 
      stepping stone for deep space exploration and a source of valuable resources. Nations such as India, Russia, the United States, 
      and China have been actively pursuing lunar missions, and initiatives like NASA's Artemis and the Lunar Gateway highlight the 
      global effort to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon.</p>

    <p>The complexity of planning lunar missions lies in the intricate gravitational forces of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, which lack 
      a closed-form analytical solution beyond the classical two-body problem. To design more intricate and fuel-efficient trajectories, 
      the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) is a valuable model. In this model, three bodies are considered: two massive ones, 
      like the Earth and Moon, in fixed circular orbits, and one massless body, such as a satellite, moving within their gravitational field. 
      Despite lacking an analytical solution, the CR3BP offers better insights into lunar orbits, leading to the identification of unique 
      orbits like the Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The NRHO is of strategic importance, especially for NASA's Lunar Gateway project, 
      as it provides continuous access to the lunar surface, facilitating scientific research, resource exploration, and serving as a hub 
      for future lunar and deep space missions.</p>

    <p>The trajectory design for lunar missions and station-keeping is a complex challenge, 
      particularly when using low-thrust propulsion systems. This requires the use of numerical optimization methods such as multiple
      shooting. However, it is difficult to find good initial estimates for these methods. Without a good initial estimate, these algorithms
      will take a long time to converge, or might converge at a local extremum. Recently, Artifical Neural Networks have emerged as a
      good tool for solving difficult non-linear problems. Hence my research topic is on <b>"Machine-Learning based Methods for Trajectory 
      Design of Low-Thrust Spacecraft in Cis-Lunar Space"</b>. This fusion of numerical methods and machine learning techniques 
      offers a promising approach for addressing the intricacies of lunar mission planning and execution.</p>

        <p>I worked at the Space Dynamics and Flight Control Laboratory under Dr. Dipak Kumar Giri.
          My work consisted of developing a 5-dof frictionless satellite simulator.
          I primarily worked on the software and simulation aspect of the project.</p>

        <p>In this position I worked on developing an orbit determination software.
          First we determine a good estimate of a satellite orbit using data from multiple ground stations.
          Next, we predict the future location and velocity of the satellite.
          I also worked on a good GUI to visualize the results.</p>
